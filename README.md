# SRC - Scooter's Revenge Coin

Scooter's Revenge Coin is an implementation of the ERC-20 token standard with a few added features, the primary one being its anti-rugpull function. 

# Description 

As stated above, Scooter's Revenge Coin is a basic implementation of the ERC-20 token standard with a few additional features.
  - Anti-Rugpull. This function serves to protect holders from getting massively dumped on by a whale.
  - Voting/Governance. This project was inspired my Andre Cronje of YFI fame. YFI started off as a "valueless governance token", so will this one. 
  - Staking. This is getting added mainly so I can learn about the implementation of staking. At the end of the day, this project is being made simply so I can put it on my resume. Note: Will use the SNX StakingRewards contract.
  
# Roadmap 

- Deploy the smart contract.
- List it on Uniswap.
- Get website live so holders can stake their tokens without having to interact directly with the contract.

# Tokenomics 

To begin, there will be 30,000 SCR tokens minted. 3,000 of these coins will be held for me and the fellas. The remaining 27,000 will be put into circulation
within the Uniswap liquidity pool. People who purchase SCR and subsecuently stake it will be rewarded 1% of the amount they stake, leading to a small inflation of
the supply over time.
